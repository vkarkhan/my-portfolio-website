# Portfolio Website

This project contains a simple HTML/CSS/JS site for showcasing projects and publications.

## Opening `index.html` locally

1. From the repository root, start a small HTTP server. A quick option using Python is:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   
   This serves the files at <http://localhost:8000/>.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.
3. The site pulls fonts, icon libraries and other scripts from public CDNs. **Network access is required** unless you have installed the local asset copies from TaskÂ 2.

## What to look for

- In the **Publications & Research** section, a blue hydrogen molecule should rotate smoothly, confirming that the 3D animation is working.
- Click the **Publications List** button and ensure it opens the Google Scholar profile in a new tab.
