# Portfolio Website

This site showcases my work and runs entirely in the browser. The `assets/` folder contains copies of third-party libraries so the page can be viewed without needing to fetch them from a CDN.

## Offline setup

1. Ensure the following files are present in `assets/`:
   - `assets/js/three.min.js`
   - `assets/js/aos.js`
   - `assets/css/aos.css`
   - `assets/js/vanilla-tilt.min.js`
   - Roboto font files referenced in `assets/fonts/roboto.css`
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser. No internet connection is required for the site itself.

**Note:** The repository may contain placeholder files if the assets could not be downloaded in the Codex environment. Replace them with the actual library files for full functionality.
